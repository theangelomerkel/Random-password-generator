# Random-password-generator
This script uses the random and string modules to generate a random password of a specified length. The function generate_password(length: int) takes an integer as an input, which represents the length of the password. Inside the function, it creates a list of possible characters that can be used in a password, that is upper and lower case alphabets, digits, and special characters. Then it uses the random.choice method to randomly select characters from the list and join them to form a password of the specified length.

You can call the generate_password() function with the desired length of the password and it will return the generated password.
